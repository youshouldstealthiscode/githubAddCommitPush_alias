# githubAddCommitPush_alias
script that automates github add, commit, and push

Hereâ€™s a Bash script that can automate the sequence of `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` based on user inputs. The script will prompt the user for a commit message and, if none is entered, it will use a default message.

You can also tie this script to an alias for quick use.

### **Bash Script: `gitAddCommitPush.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Default commit message if the user doesn't provide one
DEFAULT_MESSAGE="Auto-commit: default message"

# Function to ask for a commit message
get_commit_message() {
    read -p "Commit message? (Enter here, no need for quotation marks, I will add them if they are missing): " commit_message

    # If user doesn't provide a message, use the default message
    if [[ -z "$commit_message" ]]; then
        echo "$DEFAULT_MESSAGE"
    else
        echo "$commit_message"
    fi
}

# Main script execution

# Step 1: Add all changes to the staging area
echo "Adding all changes to the staging area..."
git add .

# Step 2: Get commit message
commit_message=$(get_commit_message)

# Step 3: Commit with the provided or default message
echo "Committing with message: \"$commit_message\""
git commit -m "$commit_message"

# Step 4: Push to the remote repository
# Ask for the branch name, default to "main" if not provided
read -p "Branch to push to? (Default: main): " branch
branch=${branch:-main}

# Push to the specified branch
echo "Pushing changes to the remote branch: $branch"
git push origin "$branch"

# Inform the user that the process is complete
echo "Git operations completed."
```

### **How to Set Up and Use the Script**

1. **Save the Script:**
   - Save the script to a file called `git_auto_push.sh` in your preferred directory (e.g., `~/scripts`).

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Run the following command to make the script executable:

     ```bash
     chmod +x ~/scripts/git_auto_push.sh
     ```

3. **Create an Alias for Quick Access:**
   - To tie the script to a Git alias, add the following line to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` if you're using Zsh) for quick access:

     ```bash
     alias gitpush="~/scripts/git_auto_push.sh"
     ```

   - After adding the alias, reload your shell configuration by running:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for Zsh
     ```

4. **Run the Script:**
   - From any Git repository, you can now run the following command to perform the sequence of actions:

     ```bash
     gitpush
     ```

### **What the Script Does:**
- **Step 1**: Adds all changes (new, modified, or deleted files) to the staging area using `git add .`.
- **Step 2**: Prompts the user for a commit message. If no message is entered, a default message (`Auto-commit: default message`) is used.
- **Step 3**: Commits the changes with the provided or default commit message.
- **Step 4**: Asks the user for the branch name to push the changes to. If no branch is entered, it defaults to `main`. The script then pushes the changes using `git push origin branch_name`.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Default Branch**: The script will push to `main` if no branch is specified. You can change this default in the script or modify it when prompted.
- **Commit Message**: The script automatically adds quotation marks to the commit message if the user forgets them, simplifying the input process.
